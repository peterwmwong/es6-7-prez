SystemJS New Features

CONFIG
---

main / data-main - loaded after config
config / data-config - if no value, uses "config.json". If a value, loaded relative to baseURL
baseurl / data-baseurl - sets loader baseURL
System.config() - overrides System.x values

META
---

System.meta['module/name']

"format amd";

FORMATS
---

Formats are now supported through meta as opposed to System.formats

This system was rewritten to allow circular references

metadata.deps
metadata.execute(require, exports, moduleName)
metadata.executingRequire

System.register
---

New hook handling is based on modifying the load record.

The load record is then passed through the default hook next automatically.

If you return a value, you had better know what you are doing, as skipping the default will disable other extension features,
which may not be obvious (for example meta hooks into translate).

Instantiate hook now avaiable.
